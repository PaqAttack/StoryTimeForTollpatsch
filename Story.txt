On a cool day in Fall, a software developer was on their way to their favorite ratskeller 
hoping to find a quiet place to work on a project.
On the way a song by Rammstein came on. The delightful smells from a nearby baeckerei made 
the drive delightful.
As they passed the Baeckerei, they spotted a Porsche parked outside, making them wonder if the driver was inside enjoying Apfelkuchen.
The crisp air and scent of fresh bread set the perfect tone for an inspired afternoon.
They finally arrived at the ratskeller, where a BMW parked outside hinted at a crowd inside enjoying Bratwurst and Beirgarten festivities.
